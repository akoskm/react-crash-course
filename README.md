# 🧑‍🏫 Motivation

There are many ways to learn React.

The "build apps" advice is one of the most popular.

Although I'm a big believer of learning by doing, it can take days or weeks to learn the basics if you know nothing about React.

That's because the React ecosystem is *vast*.

Should I go with Remix, Next.js, or maybe Astro, or just stick to Create React App? Should I use a UI library like daisyUI, or maybe TailwindCSS?

You can spend a ton of time picking the best tools, **without** actually building anything.

*But the time is already up.*

Tomorrow you start that internship or will inherit some React codebase as part of your promotion.

So I wanted to create a course that gives you the necessary knowledge without the unnecessary fluff to:
 - #### be able to join an internship quickly
 - #### get working on a React codebase in your company, even if you have never used React before
 - #### learn the basics of React and build upon this knowledge to increase your skillset and worth

# ⛩️ Structure

You'll build a Personal Productivity Tool (aka. a Todo app 🥁) to manage your daily tasks. This tool will include task addition, priority setting, searching through tasks, and tracking the total number of tasks.

Each component you build will contribute to the final app.

At the end of each chapter you'll learn something **useful and applicable**.

# 🧑‍💻 How this course works?

It's very simple! All you need is a browser (you already have one if you're reading this) and an editor (such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)). Then do the following:

1. Select an exercise - preferably start from [0_about_react](/0_about_react)
1. Read README.md for that exercise. It contains all the React theory you need to know, a quiz and further instructions.
1. Save the 0_practice.html (or whatever practice you're working on) to your computer
1. Open 0_practice.html in your editor and follow the instructions
1. Once done, open 0_practice.html in your browser
1. Compare your solution against 0_answer.html (or 1_answer, etc, depending on the exercise you're doing)
1. Do the next exercise

# 🐈 For whom is this course?

This course is for people who are interested in Web Technologies and want to build fast web apps with the most popular UI library.

It's popularity kept rising over the years [according to multiple surveys](https://gist.github.com/tkrotoff/b1caa4c3a185629299ec234d2314e190).

## Required Knowledge
 - Basic HTML
 - Basic JavaScript

# 🧟‍♀️ Who This Course Is Not For

People who already know the basics of React, like handling events, using state, props and basic hooks.

# 🧐 Isn't react.dev Enough?

React has one of the best documentations out there—I use it more often than you think.

It is an excellent source to learn *how React works*.

But if you need to learn React just to be able to contribute to a codebase or recognize some patterns in an existing UI to make changes quickly, you're out of luck.

All of these UIs contain text inputs, comboboxes, dropdowns and shared components, and while react.dev describes their APIs, it's more like a documentation of what they are capable of and not a walkthrough of how they are used in the app you'll work on.

This course, unlike react.dev, offers you **a structured way** to learn **how to use** these components and **how to combine** them for a more complex UI.
