# Motivation

The "just make a project" advice is common, but it can take days to weeks to execute.

Why?

The React ecosystem is *vast*.

Should I go with Remix, Next.js or maybe Astro, or just stick to Create React App?

Should I use a UI library like daisyUI, or maybe TailwindCSS.

You can spend a ton of time to pick the best tools, **without** actually building anything.

*But the time is already up.*

Tomorrow you start that internship, or will inherit some React codebase from your former colleagues.

So I wanted to create a course that gives you the necessary knowledge, without the unnecessary fluff to:
 - be able to join an internship quickly
 - get working on a React codebase in your company, even if you never used React before
 - learn the basics of React and build up on this knowledge to increase your skillset and worth

## Isn't react.dev enough?

React has an amazing documentationâ€“I use it more often than you think.

The getting started documentation is an excellent source to learn React works.

But if you need to learn React just to be able to contribute to a codebase or recognize some patterns in an existing UI to make changes quickly, you're out of luck.

All of these UIs contain text inputs, comboboxes, dropdowns and shared components, and while react.dev describes their APIs, it's more like a documentation of what they are capable of and not a walkthrough of how they are used in the app you'll work on.

This course, unlike react.dev, offers you **a structured way** to learn **how to use** these components and **how to combine** them for a more complex UI.
