# Motivation

The "just make a project" advice is common, but it can take days to weeks to execute.

Why?

The React ecosystem is *vast*.

Should I go with Remix, Next.js, or maybe Astro, or just stick to Create React App?

Should I use a UI library like daisyUI, or maybe TailwindCSS?

You can spend a ton of time picking the best tools, **without** actually building anything.

*But the time is already up.*

Tomorrow you start that internship or will inherit some React codebase as part of your promotion.

So I wanted to create a course that gives you the necessary knowledge without the unnecessary fluff to:
 - be able to join an internship quickly
 - get working on a React codebase in your company, even if you have never used React before
 - learn the basics of React and build upon this knowledge to increase your skillset and worth

## Structure

You'll build a Personal Productivity Tool (aka. a Todo app ü•Å) to manage your daily tasks. This tool will include task addition, priority setting, searching through tasks, and tracking the total number of tasks.

Each component you build will contribute to the final app.

At the end of each chapter you'll learn something **useful and applicable**.

## Who is this course for?

This course is for people who are interested in Web Technologies and want to build fast web apps with the most popular UI library.

It's popularity kept rising over the years [according to multiple surveys](https://gist.github.com/tkrotoff/b1caa4c3a185629299ec234d2314e190).

### Required Knowledge
 - Basic HTML
 - Basic JavaScript

## Who is this course not for

People who already know the basics of React, like handling events, using state, props and basic hooks.

## Isn't react.dev enough?

React has one of the best documentations out there‚ÄîI use it more often than you think.

It is an excellent source to learn *how React works*.

But if you need to learn React just to be able to contribute to a codebase or recognize some patterns in an existing UI to make changes quickly, you're out of luck.

All of these UIs contain text inputs, comboboxes, dropdowns and shared components, and while react.dev describes their APIs, it's more like a documentation of what they are capable of and not a walkthrough of how they are used in the app you'll work on.

This course, unlike react.dev, offers you **a structured way** to learn **how to use** these components and **how to combine** them for a more complex UI.

## You're not alone!

A handful of emojis will guide you through this journey! Whenever you see one of these emojis, you should:

üë∑ - do the thing

üí≠ - remember this, because we already mentioned it

‚òïÔ∏è - you can read this, but it's not essential to the course

‚ö†Ô∏è - common mistakes

üí° - helpful information, best practices, recommendations
