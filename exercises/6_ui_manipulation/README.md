# UI manipulation

In this chapter you'll learn how to manipulate the UI in JSX, show and hide certain elements from the user.

# Why it matters?

Believe it or not, for most web apps, an autocomplete or a filter-list is as complicated as a UI gets. Learning a few patterns is enough to understand most web applicationsâ€”whether it's an autocomplete, some other UI filter, or a dynamic table.

# [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect)

## Syntax

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // side effect
}, [ /* dependencies */])
```

The other frequently used built-in hook besides `useState` is `useEffect`. Think of `useEffect` as an if-then, instead of a lifecycle function.

`useEffect` runs when the values inside it's dependency array change.

So, for example, if I have a state variable called `taskName` and I want `useEffect` to print `taskName` to the console every time it changes, I'd write the following `useEffect`:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(taskName);
}, [taskName])
```

And if I were typing buy milk in the input, the console would should this:
```
b
bu
buy
buy
buy m
buy mi
buy mil
buy milk
```

We'll use this to display a filtered list of tasks to the user. No other JSX syntax is needed!

Let's jump into the quiz!

# Quiz

Remember the last quiz?

```jsx
function PriorityDropdown () {
  return (
    <select>
      {['Low', 'Medium', 'High'].map(
        priority => <option key={priority} value={priority}>{priority}</option>
      )}
    </select>
  );
}
```

Knowing that `{}` runs pure JavaScript, how would you modify the above function to display only those options that contains four or more characters?

ðŸ’¡ You can chain array function like filter and map like this:
```js
array
  .filter(element => condition) // return only the elements that satisfy "condition"
  .map(element => element) // do something with "element"
```

  ```jsx
  function PriorityDropdown () {
    return (
      <select>
        {['Low', 'Medium', 'High']
          .filter(priority => priority.length >= 4)
          .map(
          priority => <option key={priority} value={priority}>{priority}</option>
        )}
      </select>
    );
  }
  ```

# Exercise

In this exercise, we'll build a filter component. I'll give you a list of tasks, and using a FormInput, you'll display only the tasks that begin with the text the user enters.

To achieve this, while reusing our existing component, we'll also introduce a new concept: lifting state up. In React, lifting state up means moving state from a child component to a parent component to share state between components.
