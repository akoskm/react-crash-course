# UI manipulation

In this chapter you'll learn how to manipulate the UI in JSX, show and hide certain elements from the user.

# Why it matters?

Believe it or not, for most web apps, an autocomplete is as complicated as a UI gets. Learning a few patterns is enough to understand most web applicationsâ€”whether it's an autocomplete, some other UI filter, or a dynamic table.

# Syntax

No special syntax need here! We already learned that JSX is capable of running plan JavaScript. Let's jump into the quiz!

# Quiz

Remember the last quiz?

```jsx
function PriorityDropdown () {
  return (
    <select>
      {['Low', 'Medium', 'High'].map(
        priority => <option key={priority} value={priority}>{priority}</option>
      )}
    </select>
  );
}
```

Knowing that `{}` runs pure JavaScript, how would you modify the above function to display only those options that contains four or more characters?

ðŸ’¡ You can chain array function like filter and map like this:
```js
array
  .filter(element => condition) // return only the elements that satisfy "condition"
  .map(element => element) // do something with "element"
```

  ```jsx
  function PriorityDropdown () {
    return (
      <select>
        {['Low', 'Medium', 'High']
          .filter(priority => priority.length >= 4)
          .map(
          priority => <option key={priority} value={priority}>{priority}</option>
        )}
      </select>
    );
  }
  ```
