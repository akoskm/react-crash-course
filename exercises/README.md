# Mission

Hey there, future React developer! ðŸ‘‹

Real talk first...

Learning how a React app should be built and how they are actually built are two very different things.

I've seen several React front ends over my career, and without exception, every single one of them had either a special pattern or a way of doing things that you just don't normally see.

So, I don't want you to think that by the time you finish this course, you're ready to jump into any real-world application development.

However, I want to **give you confidence in the basics**: handling events, using or passing down state or props. These stayed the same, because there just aren't many ways to do these things in React.

## What Are We Going to Build?

A Todo app, of course, but hear me out...

You know what's cool about starting with a todo app? You already know what you'll have in the end. No confusing requirements, no wondering if you're doing it right - just you, turning your React knowledge into something familiar. Every component you create, every state update you handle, it's all going to click because, I think we as humanity can all agree on what an "Add Task" button should do.

And the best part?

While you're implementing these features you're already familiar with you **exercise your React muscles**. ðŸ’ª

Welcome to the course where your React journey begins with something simple but complete.

Let's build something together!
