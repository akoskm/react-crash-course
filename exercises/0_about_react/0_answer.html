        In this example, React is loaded directly from a CDN using script tags.
        This approach is used for simplicity in this course, but in a real-world project,
        you would typically install React and its dependencies using npm or yarn.

      Yep, it's an empty div in the beginning.
      React renders everything it produces inside this div.
      This is similar to what happens in real-world projects.

      <div id="root"></div>

      <script type="text/babel">
          function SaveButton() {
              return (
                  <button>Save</button>
              );
          }

          // ☕️ this where React produces your component
          ReactDOM.render(<SaveButton />, document.getElementById('root'));
