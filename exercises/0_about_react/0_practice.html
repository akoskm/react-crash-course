        In this example, React is loaded directly from a CDN using script tags.
        This approach is used for simplicity in this course, but in a real-world project,
        you would typically install React and its dependencies using npm or yarn.

      Yep, it's an empty div in the beginning.
      React renders everything it produces inside this div.
      This is similar to what happens in real-world projects.

            // üë∑ Create a "Save" button using JSX. If you forget the syntax, check index.md.
            // ‚ö†Ô∏è React components must return any valid React element. It can be a <div />, strings,
            // numbers, empty nodes like null, undefined, true, false or null.
            // "Nothing was returned from render." means your component didn't return any of those.
          }

          // ‚òïÔ∏è this where React produces your component
