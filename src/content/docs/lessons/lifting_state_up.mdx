This chapter will show you an important concept in React: lifting state up.

# Why it matters?

Components don't exist in a vacuum. It's not the just users who interact with them but also other components that react to their changes. Filtering is a great example of this:

you type stuff into one input, while a component showing a list of thing updates. This is only possible if the state that captures what you've typed is also accessible to the component doing the filtering.

There are a couple of ways to achieve this in React, but the simplest thing to do for component that are sitting next to each other, is lifting the state up.

# Syntax

We already saw that we can pass things such as `labelName` to our `FormInput` component. We can also pass in other values and functions.

Here's the idea.

Right now form is sitting inside FormInput and nobody outside of FormInput has access to it:

```jsx
function FormInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  return (
    <input
      onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
      value={value}
    />
  );
}

function Form() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FormInput />
      <Filter filterText={value}/> {/* value is not defined ðŸ˜¥ */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

But it's needed by the filter component, so what can we do? We can move the state into Form and pass in value and setValue to FormInput as props.

```jsx
function FormInput({ value, setValue }) {
  return (
    <input
      onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
      value={value}
    />
  );
}

function Form() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  return (
    <div>
      <FormInput value={value} setValue={setValue}/>
      <Filter filterText={value}/> {/* value is there! ðŸ˜ƒ */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
