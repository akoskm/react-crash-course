In this exercise you'll learn how to handle events with React.

# Why it matters?

Interactive elements are the at heart of every web-application. Activating a button can start network requests, show or hide different parts of the UI.

# The Button Component
We already talked about how JSX looks like HTML.

This similarity doesn't end at tag names, like `<button>`, but extends to attributes as well.

The standard HTML button inherits the global attributes of HTML elements, including the event handler attribute `onclick`. The only difference is, React uses `camelCase` naming in JSX.

ðŸ’­ What do you think, what would be the correct JSX event handler for `onclick`?

  You guessed right, itâ€™s `onClick`!

# Quiz

`onClick`, similar to the HTML buttonâ€™s `onclick` receives a function. When the button is clicked the function runs.

Now make your save button show an window.alert to the user. You can use `window.alert('Button clicked!')` for this.

<details>

  ```
  function SaveButton () {
    return <button onClick={() => window.alert('Button clicked!')}>Save</button>
  }
  ```

# Exercise

Now let's take this a step further by observing the even object that gets into this function.

  In React, synthetic events are a cross-browser wrapper around native events.
  They ensure compatibility across all browsers and improve consistency in event handling.
