React's mechanism to pass data from parent to child components.

# Why it matters?

Imagine how crazy it would be to build a car from scratch every time you want to go to the town.

Not as complicated as building a car, it'd still take time to copy and paste and add small changes to a piece of code you want to reuse in your app.

The `FormInput` component we created during our previous practice is a great example of this. Let's see how we can use props to reuse the FormInput for a "Task name" and a "Task priority" input.

# A Reusable Form Input component

The syntax for passing props to components looks like this:

```jsx
<FormInput propName=propValue>
```

Above, we're passing `propValue` to the `FormInput` component inside the variable `propName`. using the JSX syntax.
In React every component’s input parameter is an object containing all props that have been passed to that particular component.
So inside the `FormInput` component, you can access `propName` as a variable:

```jsx
function Form(props) {
    // access props.propName
    return (
        <>
          <FormInput />
          <SaveButton />
        </>
    );
}
```

But what you'll see most often is destructuring the `props` object immediately:
```jsx
function Form({ propName }) {
    // use as propName
    return (
        <>
          <FormInput />
          <SaveButton />
        </>
    );
}
```

## Using values inside JSX

Whenever you want to use the value of the property you passed you'll use the `{propName}` syntax in JSX. So for example, if you component accepts a `buttonName` prop, you can use it in JSX like this:

```jsx
<button>{buttonName}</button>
```

# Quiz

How would you modify the FormInput component so that the label is dynamic and it can be set with the help of the `labelText` property?

  ```jsx
  function FormInput ({ labelText }) {
    return (
      <label>
        {labelText}
        <input type="text">
      </label>
    );
  }
  ```

# Exercise

Let’s modify the `FormInput` component and update the `Form` component so we have two separate inputs: "Task name" and "Task priority".
